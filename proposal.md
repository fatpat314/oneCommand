1. What problem will your MakeUtility solve? What are your goals? Who will use your application?



⭐️ Goals

👥Audience
Everyone! Software engineers or anyone who has to run a series of commands frequently.


2. What existing packages could help you build your project? How does each library help you accomplish your goal(s)?

3. Break down your project into small tasks. What steps will you take to implement the project?
Put them in order below. Use as many spaces as you need to describe each step:



🔢Task Description                                                        🕑Hours              📅Done By


   1.    Accept and return user input                                        >2                  7/4
   2.   Can execute one predetermined command                                3?                  7/6
   3.    Use user input to dictate a single command and run it.              3?                  7/8
   4.    Promt user to enter list of commands/accept list                    2                   7/10
   5.    Format and save the list of commands under one name                 4?                  7/12     
   6.  Allow user to input list of commands that are then saved and named so the user is able to recall the list of commands and have them execute in order.                                                                    6?                  7/15
